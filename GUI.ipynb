    "This script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Python's `Tkinter` library. The application loads Instagram post descriptions from a CSV file, displays a random selection of posts, and identifies locations or organizations mentioned in the posts using a pre-trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model and Tokenizer Loading**:\n",
    "   - The script loads a pre-trained NER model (`sigaldanilov/nerbart_model`) and a tokenizer from Hugging Face.\n",
    "   - These are used to process Instagram post descriptions and predict named entities (locations, persons, organizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Posts from CSV**:\n",
    "   - The `load_posts_from_csv()` function loads a CSV file containing Instagram post descriptions. The CSV file is expected to have a column called `'translated'` (which likely contains translated post texts).\n",
    "   - The function skips problematic rows using `on_bad_lines='skip'` to ensure robustness and returns a list of valid post descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetching Random Posts**:\n",
    "   - The `fetch_random_posts()` function randomly selects 6 Instagram posts from the loaded CSV data to display in the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **NER Prediction**:\n",
    "   - The `predict_ner()` function takes a text input (an Instagram post), tokenizes it, and uses the NER model to predict the named entities (locations, organizations, etc.) within the text.\n",
    "   - The function processes tokens and their labels (e.g., \"B-LOC\" for a beginning of a location) to extract and return a list of identified locations and organizations.\n",
    "   - The NER predictions are refined to handle subword tokens (which BERT models produce) by merging tokens properly (like combining \"##tel\" and \"aviv\" into \"Tel Aviv\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Displaying Posts and Details**:\n",
    "   - The `show_locations()` function loads posts from the CSV, clears any previous content in the display frame, and shows a random selection of posts in a two-column layout.\n",
    "   - Each post is displayed with a short preview (first 50 characters) and a clickable card (styled as a small frame) to view full details.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Detailed View of Posts**:\n",
    "   - When a post is clicked, the `show_post_details()` function opens a new window that shows the full post text along with identified locations (predicted by the NER model).\n",
    "   - If no locations are found in the post, the window displays \"No locations identified.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### GUI Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Window**: \n",
    "   - The main window displays a title (\"Randomly selected Instagram Posts\") and a button (\"Fetch and Show Locations\").\n",
    "   - The button triggers the fetching and displaying of random Instagram posts from the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scrollable Frame for Posts**:\n",
    "   - The posts are displayed in a scrollable frame, allowing users to scroll through multiple posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clickable Post Cards**:\n",
    "   - Each post is displayed as a clickable card. The card shows an image placeholder (gray square) and a short text preview.\n",
    "   - Clicking the card opens a detailed view with the full post and location information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Application Works:\n",
    "1. The user loads the application, and the main window appears.\n",
    "2. Clicking the \"Fetch and Show Locations\" button triggers the loading and random selection of Instagram posts from the CSV file.\n",
    "3. The posts are displayed in a scrollable, two-column layout.\n",
    "4. Clicking on a post opens a new window showing the full post and any locations identified by the NER model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Random Sampling**: Shows a random selection of 6 posts each time the user clicks the button.\n",
    "- **NER Location Extraction**: The application identifies locations and organizations in the post using a pre-trained NER model.\n",
    "- **Interactive GUI**: Users can click on posts to view detailed information, making the interface user-friendly.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: The code handles errors when loading CSV data, such as skipping bad rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Flow:\n",
    "1. **User Clicks \"Fetch and Show Locations\"**: A random sample of posts is displayed.\n",
    "2. **User Clicks on a Post**: A new window opens with the full text and the locations identified by the NER model.\n",
    "3. **Location Prediction**: The NER model processes the text and predicts named entities related to locations or organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application provides an interactive and visual way to display NER results on social media posts, focusing on locations and organizations mentioned in the text."
