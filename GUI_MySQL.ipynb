    "This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `Tkinter` library to display Instagram post descriptions stored in a MySQL database. The script fetches random posts from the database, displays them in the GUI, and uses a pre-trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify locations and organizations in each post. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Model and Tokenizer Loading**:\n",
    "   - The script loads a pre-trained NER model (`sigaldanilov/nerbart_model`) and tokenizer from Hugging Face, which are used to analyze text and detect named entities like locations and organizations.\n",
    "   - The `label_names` list defines the NER labels (e.g., `B-LOC` for location beginning, `I-ORG` for inside an organization name).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Database Connection**:\n",
    "   - The `connect_to_database()` function connects to a MySQL database using the `mysql.connector` library. The database credentials are specified (host, user, password, and database name).\n",
    "   - The database is assumed to have a table named `posts_new` containing Instagram post descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Fetching Posts from the Database**:\n",
    "   - The `fetch_random_posts()` function retrieves the first 1000 Instagram posts from the `posts_new` table and randomly selects 6 posts for display. The `LIMIT 1000` ensures that only the first 1000 rows are fetched, which is a performance optimization.\n",
    "   - The selected posts are then randomly sampled to display in the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **NER Prediction**:\n",
    "   - The `predict_ner()` function processes each post text and uses the NER model to predict named entities (locations, organizations, etc.).\n",
    "   - It tokenizes the text, runs it through the model, and interprets the output to identify any detected locations or organizations.\n",
    "   - The function handles subword tokens (e.g., \"##tel\" and \"aviv\") by merging them into a single entity (e.g., \"Tel Aviv\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Displaying Posts in the GUI**:\n",
    "   - The `show_locations()` function is responsible for fetching posts from the database, clearing any previous content, and displaying the posts in a two-column layout.\n",
    "   - Each post is displayed with a short version (first 50 characters), and clicking on a post opens a new window with full details.\n",
    "   - The posts are displayed using `Tkinter` frames that mimic Instagram post cards, and an image placeholder is added (though it's just a gray square for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Post Detail Window**:\n",
    "   - When a post is clicked, the `show_post_details()` function opens a new window displaying the full post text and any identified locations.\n",
    "   - If no locations are found, the window shows a message stating \"No locations identified.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **GUI Layout**:\n",
    "   - The main window contains a title and a button (\"Fetch and Show Locations\") that triggers the display of random Instagram posts.\n",
    "   - The posts are shown in a scrollable frame, allowing the user to browse through them.\n",
    "   - Each post is presented in a card-like layout, and the user can click on a post to view its full details in a new window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Key GUI Components**:\n",
    "   - **`Tkinter.Tk()`**: The main window is created with this class.\n",
    "   - **Scrollable Frame**: The posts are displayed in a scrollable frame created using a `Tkinter.Canvas` and a vertical scrollbar.\n",
    "   - **Fetch Button**: A button is added to trigger the random fetching and displaying of posts.\n",
    "   - **Two-Column Layout**: The posts are arranged in two columns using a grid layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the Application:\n",
    "1. **User Interaction**: \n",
    "   - The user clicks the \"Fetch and Show Locations\" button.\n",
    "   - The application connects to a MySQL database, retrieves Instagram posts, and displays a random selection in the GUI.\n",
    "2. **NER Location Detection**:\n",
    "   - The NER model processes each post and identifies any locations or organizations mentioned.\n",
    "   - Clicking a post shows full details along with any detected locations.\n",
    "3. **Interactivity**: \n",
    "   - The user can scroll through posts, click on them to see details, and interact with the GUI easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is a practical tool for browsing Instagram posts from a database and analyzing them for location-related content using machine learning models."
